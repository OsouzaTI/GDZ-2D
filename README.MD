# GDZ Engine 2D

## The engine

This is my first time programming a game engine in a month of study, i benigne with book called "OpenGL Game Development" writed by Chris Seddon, 2005.

## How the engine work

This engine work in a system components attach, it's a very simple concept of objects. Create a static entity manager and static asset manager for your game, after that you create a entity with components do you want and call the method inside entity manager called "update" in your method game update.
